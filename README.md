# Relation Extraction Using Word Embeddings

This library was created as implementation of our method of semantic relationship extraction as a part of my master's thesis.
The goal of our method is to take small set of exemplary pairs defining semantic relation and expand it with new pairs.
This *seed* set can be for example:

> France-Paris, Italy-Rome, Germany-Berlin

when we want to define relationship between countries and their capitals.
