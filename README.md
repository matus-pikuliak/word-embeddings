# Relation Extraction Using Word Embeddings

This library was created as implementation of our method of semantic relationship extraction as a part of my master's thesis.
The goal of our method is to take small set of exemplary pairs defining semantic relation and expand it with new pairs.
This *seed* set can be for example:

> France-Paris, Italy-Rome, Germany-Berlin

Our goal here would be to find new pairs of countries and their respective capitals.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need to have these libraries installed to run this library. We are indicating versions we are using.

* *Python* (2.7.6)
* *[gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)* (0.12.4) library
* *NumPy* (1.11.0) and *SciPy* (0.13.3) libraries (they are also prerequisites of *gensim* so you should have them installed already)

### Configuration

You can configure several options in our *config.py* file:

* **word2vec_file** - Path to file with word embeddings dataset. We are using binary format used also by word2vec or gensim libraries. Well trained datasets can be found on official [word2vec page](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/). You need to download such file for our method to work. We were using [Google News dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing) (1.5GB).
* **svm_folder** - Path to folder where files generated by SVM algorithm will be saved. This folder will be used only when running our method with *PU Learning* rating algorithm.
* **default_output_file** - This is where results from our method are being written by default.
